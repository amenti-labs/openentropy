# WiFi RSSI Entropy Findings — 2025-02-11

## Status: FAILED (tool deprecated)
- **Issue:** `airport` CLI is deprecated on modern macOS and returns no data
- **Alternative:** `wdutil info` requires sudo
- **Fix:** Update script to use CoreWLAN via Python objc bridge, or use `wdutil` with sudo

## Notes
- The `airport` binary still exists but outputs only a deprecation warning
- `system_profiler SPAirPortDataType` doesn't expose RSSI in its output
- Need pyobjc-framework-CoreWLAN for proper macOS WiFi access without sudo
